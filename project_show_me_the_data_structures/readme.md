## Data Structure Questions 
For this project, you will answer six questions laid out in the sections. 

The questions cover a variety of topics related to the data structures. 

Write up a clean and efficient answer in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency of your code and your design choices.

## Project Submission
### Submission Instructions
**Required** 

* **Answer all 6 problems** listed in the previous concepts. 
* **Code solutions must be in a separate file like "problem_1.py".** You can submit your answers by uploading a single .zip file or connecting to your GitHub repo. 
* For each question, **create a solution in Python (version 3)**. All solutions should be functions named as laid out in the concepts. Feel free to make additional helper functions or classes as needed. 
* In the respective "problem_1.py" files, **include at least 3 test cases for each solution**. 
    * For each test case, write the function call with the input you want to test and print it to the console". 
    * On the next line, **comment out the output you expect to see from that function call**. At least 2 of these must be edge cases, testing inputs such as null values, empty inputs, unusually large values, etc.
* **Write up an explanation for each question** in a single separate text file, PDF or markdown called "explanation_1.md". 
    * Your paragraph should not be a detailed walkthrough of the code you provided, but provide your reasoning behind decisions made in the code. For example, why did you use that data structure? You also need to explain the effciency (time and space) of your solution.
* Compress your one Python and one text file into a .zip, and submit.


**Note:** Time complexity for reading the input will not be considered in the overall complexity of the solution.
