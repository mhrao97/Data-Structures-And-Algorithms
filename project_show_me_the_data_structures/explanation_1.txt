Problem_1 explanation:
An LRU cache is a type of cache in which we remove the least recently used entry when the cache memory reaches its limit.

The algorithm uses hash map to retrieve items in constant time. The get and set functions run in constant time.
Hence the time complexity is O(1). The algorithm uses doubly linked list, hence the space complexity is O(n) where n is the cache capacity.
