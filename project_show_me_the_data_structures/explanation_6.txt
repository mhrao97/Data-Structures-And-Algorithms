Problem_6 explanation:

Union and Intersection: 
The algorithm first loops through the passed in linked lists to create union and intersection.
In order to loop through a linked list, it has to be first converted into an array or a set. This algorithm converts the linked list into a set. It also uses the built-in method of sets to get intersection.
Since the algorithm is travelling atleast once, the time complexity of the problem is O(n), where n is the size of the linked list.
The space complexity is O(n).
