Problem_5 explanation:

A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography.

In this Blockchain problem, we are using linked lists and hashing to implement blockchain.

The algorithm has 3 classes, Node, Block and Blockchain.
Node class contains a block linking to the previous node.
Block class contains the data, timestamp and BlockChain class comprises of single linked list.
The function add_block creates a block and puts it in a linked list. It calls Block class. Block class calculates hash. Time complexity for this is O(n). Since hash is calculated, time complexity depends on hash.
The algorithm uses linked list, hence the space complexity is O(n).
